      <description>Machine learning is awesome. It provides a powerful set of techniques to make data-driven decisions for tasks that require humans input. One of such tasks is image aesthetics.

ðŸŽ’ Logo is a simple programming language devised by Seymour Papert for educational purposes. A user can control the movement of a turtle which draws lines on the screen.</description>
